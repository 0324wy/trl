    "The library `lm_ppo` one can fine-tune transformer language models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The library is built with the `transformer` library by  ðŸ¤—Huggingface. Therefore, one can load pre-trained language models directly via the transformer interface."

    "## How it works\n",
    "Fine-tuning a language model via PPO consists of roughly three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rollout**: The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence.\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair.\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don't deviate to far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.\n",
